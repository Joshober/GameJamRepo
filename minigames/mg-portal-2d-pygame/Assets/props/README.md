# Props and Interactive Elements

Place prop sprites here (glass tubes, mechanical bridges, etc.)

## Recommended Assets

1. **Mechanical Bridge**
   - File: `mechanical_bridge.png` or `bridge_platform.png`
   - Should show grey platform with piston arms underneath
   - If not found, code uses programmatic generation

2. **Glass Tube**
   - File: `glass_tube.png` or `energy_tube.png`
   - Transparent tube with blue liquid/energy
   - Grey base and cap
   - If not found, code uses programmatic generation

## File Naming Convention

- `mechanical_bridge.png` - Mechanical bridge with pistons
- `glass_tube.png` - Glass container with blue liquid
- `checkered_flag.png` - Checkered flag/arrow (optional, programmatic version exists)

If files are not found, the code will fall back to programmatic generation.
