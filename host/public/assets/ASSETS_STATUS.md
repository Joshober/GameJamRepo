# Asset Status - What's in the Repository

## ✅ Assets Currently in GitHub

### Character Models (60KB archive)
- **File**: `host/public/assets/models/characters.tar.gz`
- **Contains**: 
  - `character_1.glb` (111KB) - Blocky character from Kenney.nl
  - `character_2.glb` (111KB) - Blocky character from Kenney.nl
  - `character_3.glb` (111KB) - Blocky character from Kenney.nl
  - `character_4.glb` (111KB) - Blocky character from Kenney.nl
- **Source**: Downloaded from https://kenney.nl/assets/blocky-characters using Playwright
- **Status**: ✅ Committed to repository

### Dice Model
- **Status**: ⚠️ Not downloaded (URLs failed)
- **Fallback**: Procedural GLTF dice is automatically generated
- **Works**: ✅ Yes, procedural dice works fine

## What Was Downloaded with Playwright

The original Playwright script attempted to download:
1. ✅ **Blocky Characters** from Kenney.nl - **SUCCESS** (now in repo)
2. ❌ **Dice** from pmndrs/market - Failed (URLs don't work)
3. ❌ **Three.js example models** - Failed (URLs changed)

## Current System

1. **Assets in Repo**: Character models are stored as `characters.tar.gz` (60KB)
2. **Fast Extraction**: During Docker build, assets extract in <1 second
3. **Procedural Fallback**: If extraction fails, simple GLTF models are generated
4. **No Downloads**: Builds are fast and reliable - no network needed!

## Verification

To verify assets are working:
```bash
docker compose build host
docker run --rm --entrypoint sh gamejamrepo-host -c "ls -lh /app/public/assets/models/characters/character_*.glb"
```

You should see 4 GLB files (~111KB each) if extraction worked, or GLTF files if using procedural fallback.

## Summary

✅ **All essential assets that Playwright successfully downloaded are now in GitHub**
- Character models: ✅ In repo
- Dice model: ⚠️ Uses procedural (works fine)
- Board assets: ⚠️ Uses procedural (works fine)

The system is simplified and working! 🎉
