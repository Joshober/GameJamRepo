# 3D Assets Verification Report

## ✅ Confirmed: All Recommended Assets Are True 3D Models

This document verifies that all assets recommended for the video game-themed board game are **genuine 3D models**, not 2D sprites or textures.

## 1. ✅ Kytric's Voxel Board Games Pack

**URL**: https://kytric.itch.io/board-game-assets

### Verification Evidence:
- **Page explicitly states**: "Downloadable files: **vox, obj and gltf**"
- **Available file formats**:
  - `BoardGames-gltf.zip` (1.2 MB) - **GLTF = 3D format**
  - `BoardGames-obj.zip` (1 MB) - **OBJ = 3D format**
  - `BoardGames-vox.zip` (17 MB) - **VOX = 3D voxel format**
- **Description**: "3D voxel board game asset pack"
- **Contains**: 380 different **3D models** (dice, tokens, boards, pieces)

### ✅ VERIFIED: True 3D Models
- **GLTF** = GL Transmission Format (industry standard 3D format)
- **OBJ** = Wavefront OBJ (universal 3D geometry format)
- **VOX** = MagicaVoxel format (3D voxel models)

## 2. ✅ Kenney's Hexagon Kit

**URL**: https://kenney.nl/assets/hexagon-kit

### Verification Evidence:
- **Category**: Listed as "**3D**" on Kenney.nl
- **Format**: **GLTF** (confirmed 3D format)
- **Contains**: 70+ hexagonal **3D tiles**
- **Features**: Animation support (3D models can be animated)

### ✅ VERIFIED: True 3D Models
- **GLTF** format = 3D geometry with materials and textures
- Hexagonal tiles are 3D meshes, not flat sprites

---

## 3. ✅ OpenGameArt Low Poly Dice

**URL**: https://opengameart.org/content/low-poly-3d-dice

### Verification Evidence:
- **Art Type**: Listed as "**3D Art**"
- **File formats**: 
  - **.dae** (Collada - 3D format)
  - **.blend** (Blender - 3D format)
- **Contains**: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 dice models
- **Description**: "Model files" with "UV maps" (3D terminology)

### ✅ VERIFIED: True 3D Models
- **DAE** = Collada (XML-based 3D format)
- **BLEND** = Blender's native 3D format
- UV maps indicate 3D geometry with texture mapping

---

## 4. ✅ Poly Haven Assets

**URL**: https://polyhaven.com/

### Verification Evidence:
- **All models** on Poly Haven are **3D models**
- **Formats**: GLTF, FBX, OBJ (all 3D formats)
- **Examples**:
  - Chess Set: **glTF, FBX, Blend** formats
  - Treasure Chest: **glTF, FBX** formats

### ✅ VERIFIED: True 3D Models
- Poly Haven is a **3D asset library** (not 2D)
- All downloads are 3D geometry files

---

## 5. ⚠️ Kenney Board Game Pack (2D - NOT 3D)

**URL**: https://kenney.nl/assets/boardgame-pack

### Important Note:
- This pack contains **2D PNG/SVG images** (dice faces, board pieces)
- **NOT 3D models** - these are textures/sprites
- **Use case**: Textures for 3D models or UI elements
- **Already in repo**: `dice_textures.zip` contains these 2D images

### ⚠️ CLARIFICATION: 2D Assets (Textures Only)
- These are **textures**, not 3D models
- Can be applied to 3D surfaces, but are not 3D themselves

---

## Summary: 3D vs 2D Breakdown

### ✅ TRUE 3D MODELS (Recommended):
1. **Kytric Voxel Board Games** - GLTF, OBJ, VOX formats ✅
2. **Kenney Hexagon Kit** - GLTF format ✅
3. **OpenGameArt Dice** - DAE, BLEND formats ✅
4. **Poly Haven Models** - GLTF, FBX formats ✅

### ⚠️ 2D ASSETS (Textures/UI Only):
1. **Kenney Board Game Pack** - PNG/SVG images (already in repo as textures)

---

## File Format Reference

### 3D Model Formats (True 3D):
- **.glb** / **.gltf** = GL Transmission Format (web-friendly 3D)
- **.obj** = Wavefront OBJ (universal 3D geometry)
- **.fbx** = Autodesk FBX (industry standard 3D)
- **.dae** = Collada (XML-based 3D)
- **.blend** = Blender (3D modeling software format)
- **.vox** = MagicaVoxel (3D voxel format)

### 2D Image Formats (Textures/Sprites):
- **.png** = Raster image (2D)
- **.jpg** = Raster image (2D)
- **.svg** = Vector image (2D)

---

## Conclusion

**All primary recommended assets are confirmed 3D models:**
- ✅ Kytric's pack: GLTF, OBJ, VOX (3D)
- ✅ Kenney Hexagon Kit: GLTF (3D)
- ✅ OpenGameArt Dice: DAE, BLEND (3D)
- ✅ Poly Haven: GLTF, FBX (3D)

The only 2D assets mentioned are textures (Kenney Board Game Pack PNGs), which are correctly identified as textures for use on 3D surfaces.

**All assets recommended for 3D models are verified as true 3D geometry files!** ✅
